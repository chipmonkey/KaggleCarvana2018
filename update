- reference software for:
   LB = 0.997 for UNet1024 model in my_unet_baseline.py
   LB = 0.991 for UNet128  model in my_unet_baseline.py
  (training logs are provided)

- implement accumulated gradients
- implement weighted boundary loss
- implement merge bn into conv for faster inference

   **the version is not backward compatible with previous version.

- add UNet_double_1024_5, which use 512x512 as input and predict 1024x1024 mask.
  UNet_double_1024_5 obtains LB score of 0.996.
  note that many changes are made to support label and image of different size.
  some unusec functions are broken because of this.
